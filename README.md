# Project OOP - Shop Management System
I have designed and implemented a C++ OOP application for managing a store, using the following features:
- class definition with attributes, constructors, destructors, methods, and interface;
- operator overloading;
- working with streams (console, files(text and binnary));
- inheritance, class hierarchies, polymorphism, virtual functions, and object pointer vectors;
- template classes;
- STL.
